Outgoing manager Thomas Tuchel has reportedly singled out dissenting stars in what appears an unhappy dressing room and a second-leg rescue act will be required to advance past Lazio in the last 16 of the Champions League on Tuesday. The Bavarians also began the campaign with a German Super Cup defeat and were embarrassingly knocked out of the German Cup by third-tier Saarbrucken in November. And, in February, their Germany midfielder Leon Goretzka described the current campaign as being like \"a horror movie that won't end\". So are Germany's biggest club heading for their worst season for over a decade or is this a blip they can recover from? The statistics suggest that Bayern's domestic invincibility is about to come to an end. No team has ever made up a 10-point deficit to claim the German league title and it is a gap that, if anything, only appears to be widening, with Bayern having won only one of their past four matches. Bayern have averaged almost one loss in every four games (11 of 46) under Tuchel and recently slipped to defeat in three successive matches in all competitions for the first time in almost nine years. Tuchel's record of losing 24% of his matches as Bayern boss is also the worst percentage since Soren Lerby was at the helm (1991-92), with the Dane seeing his side defeated in 41% of his fixtures in charge.\r\nFormer Chelsea and Borussia Dortmund boss Tuchel also has the lowest win percentage (63%) since Louis van Gaal (2009-11) presided over team affairs and managed 61%. Under the 50-year-old, Bayern have also lost five and won one just once in knockout matches - an ominous sign before Tuesday's second leg with Lazio."
