VALUES ('Paul Tierney not selected as referee in next round of Premier League matches', 'However, he will be the video assistant referee (VAR) for Arsenal''s home game with Brentford on Saturday. Tierney stopped play for a head injury to Reds defender Ibrahima Konate when Forest had possession in added time. He restarted play by giving Liverpool goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher the ball and Darwin Nunez scored moments later. The goal gave the visitors a 1-0 victory and came in the 99th minute - one minute and 50 seconds after the restart incident. International Football Association Board rules state the game should have restarted with Forest possession from where they had the ball outside the box. The decision did not lead directly to the goal, however, with Forest regaining possession before Nunez eventually scored the winner. Forest players and staff surrounded Tierney after full-time and coach Steven Reid was shown a red card. The City Ground club''s owner Evangelos Marinakis also pursued the officials all the way to the referee''s office.');
